            1. We select a Book & Total Number of Wickets for each player.<br><br>
2. Each Player on his/her Turn used to open the Book to a Random Page Number.<br><br>
3. Then the last digit of that Randomly Selected Page Number is noted. For example, If I opened the book randomly on to Page Number 102 so my Runs for that particular turn would be calculated as 2 Runs.<br><br>
4. After noting down the Runs scored, Book is Closed and is Opened again to a Random Page Number & follows the Steps 2 & 3.<br><br>
5. In Case the Player gets a Page Number, with its Last Digit as 0 ( for example 120 or 40 ), then the Player lose 1 Wicket.<br><br>
6. In every turn Runs are Added onto the Runs scored by the Player in his/her Previous turns. This Continues till the Player losses all his/her Wickets.<br><br>
